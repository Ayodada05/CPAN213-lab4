## Responsive Design Implementation

### Breakpoint Strategy

Breakpoints are defined in responsive.js using screen width to adapt layouts for phones and tablets. Devices under 400 use two columns, while larger or tablet screens expand to three or four. This ensures readability, balanced spacing, and consistent layout across all screen sizes
**Breakpoints Defined:**

- Small phones: < 350px width - 1 column layout
- Medium phones: 350-400px - 2 column layout
- Large phones: 400-500px - 2 column layout
- Tablets: 500-768px - 3 column layout
- Large tablets: > 768px - 4 column layout
  **Design Decisions:**
  These breakpoints were chosen to balance readability and efficient use of space across common device sizes. Smaller phones require a single column to keep text and widgets legible, while medium and large phones comfortably support two columns without crowding. Tablets provide enough screen width for three columns, giving users a desktop-like experience while maintaining touch accessibility. Larger tablets extend to four columns, maximizing data visibility for dashboard widgets. This structure ensures that each layout remains visually balanced, easy to navigate, and optimized for both portrait and landscape orientations.

### Grid System Implementation

The grid system is managed by the ResponsiveGrid component, which dynamically adjusts the number of columns based on the current breakpoint and screen orientation. It uses the getGridColumns() function from responsive.js to determine layout changes in real time. The grid maps through dashboard data to render widgets within flexible containers that automatically resize and reposition as the screen width or orientation changes. This ensures a balanced and adaptive layout where widgets remain evenly spaced and readable on all devices, from small phones to large tablets.

**Column Calculation Logic:**
The getGridColumns() function determines how many columns to display based on the current screen width breakpoint. It checks the active breakpoint returned by getBreakpoint() and assigns a column count accordingly. Small devices default to 2 columns for clarity, medium and large screens expand to 3 columns, and tablets or larger devices use 4 columns to maximize available space. This logic ensures the dashboard remains visually balanced and readable on any device size or orientation.

**Orientation Handling:**
Orientation changes are managed through the listenForOrientationChange() function in responsive.js. When the device rotates, the listener detects the new width and height, updates the layout state, and triggers a re-render of the dashboard. This allows the grid and widgets to automatically adjust their column count, spacing, and dimensions, ensuring consistent alignment and usability in both portrait and landscape modes.

### Typography Scaling

Font sizes scale dynamically using the rf() (responsive font) function from responsive.js, which adjusts text proportionally to the device’s screen dimensions. This ensures headings, labels, and values remain legible on small phones while maintaining proper hierarchy on larger screens. Typography values in the theme reference this function, allowing consistent scaling across all components and orientations

**Scaling Formula:**
The rf() function calculates font size relative to the device’s screen dimensions using a proportional scaling formula. It multiplies a base font size by a ratio of the device’s current width or height compared to a standard reference size. This ensures text grows or shrinks smoothly across different screen sizes, maintaining readability and consistent visual hierarchy on both small phones and large tablets.

**Typography Scale:**

- h1: [24]pt
- h2: [20]pt
- h3: [18]pt
- body: [16]pt
- caption: [14]pt

### Spacing Syste

The app uses a consistent spacing scale defined in the theme to maintain visual balance and alignment across components. Spacing values such as xs, sm, md, lg, and xl correspond to responsive pixel units calculated using the wp() and hp() functions. This ensures paddings and margins scale proportionally with screen size. For example, smaller screens use tighter spacing to maximize content visibility, while tablets apply larger spacing for a more open layout. Consistent spacing improves readability, touch accuracy, and overall visual harmony throughout the dashboard.
**Spacing Values:**

- xs: [4]
- sm: [8]
- md: [12]
- lg: [16]
- xl: [24]
